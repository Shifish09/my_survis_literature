This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle captured dataset for railroad segmentation and obstacle detection (UAV - RSOD). It contains high - resolution images of railroad scenes with various obstacles. The dataset includes 315 raw images, 630 labeled and 630 masked images for railroad semantic segmentation, and 315 original images for object and obstacle detection. After data augmentation, there are 2002 augmented and annotated images for obstacle detection, covering six obstacle classes. Each image is accurately annotated. The dataset is made publicly available, facilitating research and development in railroad - related computer vision applications.},
